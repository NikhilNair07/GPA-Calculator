# GPA Calculator Project
## Project Description
The GPA Calculator is a simple C++ program that allows users to calculate their Grade Point Average (GPA) based on their total marks and obtained marks. This project is designed to help students determine their GPA and corresponding letter grade for a given set of marks, making it a valuable tool for educational institutions and students alike.

## Features
Input total marks and obtained marks.
Calculate the percentage based on the obtained marks.
Determine the GPA and letter grade based on the percentage.
Display the GPA, letter grade, and the calculated percentage.
## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input the total marks and obtained marks.
The program will display the calculated GPA, letter grade, and the percentage.

## GPA Grading Scale
The GPA and letter grade are determined based on the following scale:

A+ (97-100) - GPA: 4.00
A (93-96.99) - GPA: 4.00
A- (90-92.99) - GPA: 3.7
B+ (87-89.99) - GPA: 3.3
B (83-86.99) - GPA: 3.0
B- (80-82.99) - GPA: 2.7
C+ (77-79.99) - GPA: 2.3
C (73-76.99) - GPA: 2.0
C- (70-72.99) - GPA: 1.7
D+ (67-69.99) - GPA: 1.3
D (65-66.99) - GPA: 1.0
F (0-64.99) - GPA: 0.0
## Error Handling
The program will check if the obtained marks are less than or equal to the total marks and provide an error message if the input is invalid.
